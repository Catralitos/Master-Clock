# Master-Clock

Moirai is the keeper of the Master Clock, the engine at the center of the Universe which keeps time flowing.

The Master Clock keeps the past, makes the present, and determines the future. 

Moirai has seen in the future that the Master Clock itself will break down and time will cease to be.

Yet she can not see what will bring about such a disaster. 

On the fateful day, the Master Clock starts shutting down, and knowing she only has 15 minutes before a total failure, she uses her powers to begin a time loop.

Hopefully, she can navigate the clock to collect enough abilities to reach the core and try to prevent the shutdown and escape her fate!



Master Clock is a Metroidvania, where players must explore the Master Clock in 10 minute loops. As they progress they will find abilities and upgrades to unlock new parts of the map, secrets, and shortcuts.

The game has 3 different endings, depending on how many loops it takes you and how many upgrades you collect.
